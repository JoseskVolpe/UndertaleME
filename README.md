UndertaleME is a Open-source Undertale Fight Engine project for oldschool Java-Enabled mobile devices. Developers will be able to create custom fights, dialogs, monsters, items, actions etc, and may even use it to create Undertale fangames with elaborated custom history.
<br>Some stuffs are written in portuguese into the game-side, but it's currently a experimental project and they can be easily translated<br>
